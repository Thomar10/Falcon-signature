This folder contains tests that the FALCON implementation is identical to the FALCON C reference implementation.
Furthermore, it also contains benchmarks suite for the Rust code. To run a benchmark cd into this folder and type 'cargo bench' to run all benchmarks.

To compile linux is needed and tests are expected to be run in release mode (but also works in debug).
